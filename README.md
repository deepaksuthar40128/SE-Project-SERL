  ## Drawbacks
 
 There is some drawbacks with this project üôÅ and some of them are:
 
 - We are here storing the image in mongodb itself by encoding the image (base64), which introduce `Database latency`.
 - We are here using old way ajax for intracting with server side.


 ## Improvements
 
 - We can use some web services like `AWS` or `Google cloud` to store our data.
 - We can use some javascript libraries like `React`.
